# Message-passing-neural-network-MPNN-for-molecular-property-prediction
Implemented a type of graph neural network (GNN) known as _ message passing neural network_ (MPNN) to predict graph properties. Specifically, we will implement an MPNN to predict a molecular property known as blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP).
